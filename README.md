# Steps to Run Pipeline
- Clone the repository to a local directory
- Verify Docker Desktop and Python3 have been installed with commands added to your system PATH
- Verify the docker engine is up, running, and accessible
- Open a terminal, command prompt, or powershell window and navigate to the cloned repository
- Run the `run_pipeline.py` python script to begin enviornment setup
    - For Windows the command is `python run_pipeline.py`
    - For Mac/Linux the command is `python3 run_pipeline.py`
